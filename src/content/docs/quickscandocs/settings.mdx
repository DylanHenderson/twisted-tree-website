#### Defaults
You can change the default operations when using Quick Stock to your most common usecase. You'll still be able to change these while adjusting quantities.
<Image src={settings2} alt="upload file" style={{ objectFit: 'cover', marginRight: '10px' }} />


#### Tags
Quick Stock can add or remove tags from your products after operations.
<Image src={settings1} alt="upload file" style={{ objectFit: 'cover', marginRight: '10px' }} />

#### Shopify Flow Triggers

* dateUTC - date and time of operation in UTC.
* state - one of the following: available, damaged, reserved, quality_control, safety_stock.
* reason - one of the following: correction, cycle_count_available, received, restock, damaged, shrinkage, promotion.
* amount - a number showing the adjusted quantity.
* locationName - the location name adjusted at.
* locationId - the location id adjusted at.
* variantDisplayName - the name of the product/variant adjusted.
