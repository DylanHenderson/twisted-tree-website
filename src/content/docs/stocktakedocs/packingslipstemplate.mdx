### Advantages of using Scan Picker packing slips

1. **By default, already fulfilled items are not included in Scan Picker packing slips.** Shopify packing slips include these which can make partial fulfillments error prone.
2. **Comes with order barcode by default**: You're able to skip editing the Shopify packing slip code.
3. **Location filtered**: Packing slips will by default only contain items from your current selected location.
4. **Simple styling options:** Packing slip can be styled without editing code.

### Initial setup

Head over to the packing slip template menu item in Scan Picker. You'll need to fill in some fields like your store name and address. You can also change some styling options to suite your needs.
