Twist: Stock Take allows you to run automations against each product counted during actioning. This allows non-inventory related changes to be made to products. This helps automatically fix products that may have incorrect properties. For example a product may be in draft but expected to be active.

##### The currently supported automations:
Tag additions, Tag removals, Vendor change, Status Change, Metafield change.

<Aside type="caution" title="Metafield Support">
We currently only support single line text field metafields on automations for product metafields. Please reach out if you require additional support.
