Twist: Stock Take uses filters to allow accurate reporting for stock counting of smaller sections of your store's inventory. 

The benefits of filters include:
1. **Identifying missing items**: Once you have finished counting products for your stock take, you will be able to view items that are possibly missing. These items are included in your stock take filters but were not counted.
2. **Identifying miscategorized items**: Once you have finished counting products for your stock take, you will be able to view items that are possibly miscategorized. These items are not included in your stock take filters but were still scanned during the stock take. You may want to update their categorization.

##### The currently supported filters:
Tags, Product types, Status, Vendors, Metafields.

{/* <Aside type="caution" title="Metafield Support">
We currently only support single line text field metafields on filters. Please reach out if you require additional support.
